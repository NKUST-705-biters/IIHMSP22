        Reversible steganography allows an original image to be completely restored after the extraction of hidden data embedded in a cover image. In this talk, I will talk about  a reversible scheme based on declustering strategy  for VQ compressed images. The declustering can be regarded as a preprocessing step to make the proposed steganographic method more efficient. The experimental results show that the time required for the embedding process in the proposed method is few. In addition, the reversible steganography allows an original image to be completely restored after the extraction of hidden data embedded in a cover image. In this talk, I will introduce a reversible scheme for VQ-compressed images that is based on a declustering strategy and takes advantage of the local spatial characteristics of the image. The main advantages of this method are ease of implementation, low computational demands,and no requirement for auxiliary data.
