        In most metaheuristic algorithms, the individual update process does not (fully) utilize the individual information generated in previous iterations. 
        If this useful information can be fully utilized in subsequent optimization processes, the quality of the feasible solutions produced by the algorithm 
        will be greatly improved. Based on this, a method of reusing available information of previous individuals to guide subsequent search is proposed. 
        In this method, the previous useful information is fed back to the individual update process, and then six information feedback models are proposed. 
        In these models, the individuals of previous iterations are selected in a fixed or random way, and then the useful information of the selected individuals 
        is applied to the individual update process. Then, based on the individuals generated and selected by the basic algorithm, a simple fitness weighting method 
        is used to generate new individuals. Six different information feedback models are applied to 10 metaheuristic algorithms to generate new algorithms and 
        verify the performance of the proposed information feedback model. Experiments show that these new algorithms are significantly better than the basic 
        algorithms on 14 standard test functions and 10 CEC 2011 real world problems, and further prove the effectiveness of the proposed information feedback model. 
        At the same time, the model is applied to solve many-objective optimization methods (MOEA/D and NSGA-III), and good results are achieved.

        Reversible steganography allows an original image to be completely restored after the extraction of hidden data embedded in a cover image. In this talk, I will talk about  a reversible scheme based on declustering strategy  for VQ compressed images. The declustering can be regarded as a preprocessing step to make the proposed steganographic method more efficient. The experimental results show that the time required for the embedding process in the proposed method is few. In addition, the reversible steganography allows an original image to be completely restored after the extraction of hidden data embedded in a cover image. In this talk, I will introduce a reversible scheme for VQ-compressed images that is based on a declustering strategy and takes advantage of the local spatial characteristics of the image. The main advantages of this method are ease of implementation, low computational demands,and no requirement for auxiliary data.

        Explainable AI (XAI) is essential if users want to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage this incoming generation of artificially intelligent partners. 
        DARPA introduced this model in 2017. The problem of explainability is, to some extent, the result of AI’s success. 
        In the early days of AI, the predominant reasoning methods were logical and symbolic. 
        These early systems were reasoned by performing some form of logical inference on (somewhat) human readable symbols. 
        Early systems could generate a trace of their inference steps, which then became the basis for explanation.  
        XAI is needed for multimedia processing, models, learning paradigms, and architectures as tools for trusted results.
